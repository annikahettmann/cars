This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
1. enter a new car
2. display the list of cars
3. quit and exit the program

if the user _enters a new car_, they will be prompted to enter the car's year, make, and model. it is added to the list of cars.

if the user _displays the list of cars_, the list of cars -- including the user's input cars and the preexisting ones -- will be printed.

if the user _exits the program_, the program will print "goodbye" and shut down.
